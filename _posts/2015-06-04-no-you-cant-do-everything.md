There is a line of thinking, sort of a reenactment of the ten percent of the brain myth sprinkled with _The Secret's_ ideas, which claims that "anyone can do _anything_ as long as they want it bad enough and dedicate a lot of effort into it".

It shouldn't be hard to see how innocuous motivational-guru speak at best, dangerous stubbornness at worst such wishful thinking is, nevertheless, as detox diets or eating an apple a day are to actual health guidelines, this belief has a "common sense" status in life advice now. An obvious counterargument are physical limitations. For every person on Earth there exists abilities she can only imagine herself having it. What to say about a dwarf who dreams of beating Usain Bolt? An armless fellow who wants to swim as quickly as Michael Phelps? We don't even have to fish this far for examples: talent, or should I say genetics, is a key differential that, for 90% of us, makes no amount of "dedication" or desire lower the skill gap separating the 10% best-of-the-bests.

That being said, the proponents of the "we all can do anything" idea like to point out they mean "personal goals" or "dreams", not downright limitations. That's a fuzzy definition, but whatever they mean by goals, it is still capped in one way or another. Be it time constraints (a lifetime is too short to be an expert in all fields), socio-cultural (how many opportunities have entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa?); for everyone, even if the dream is ordinary, there are chances they are _intrinsically_ not capable of seeing it through. As much as there are few people who can equal Michelangelo, there are as well a few who can't draw stick characters. It is humbling to admit, despite all the things we are good at, there are some we suck hard time. Say that we are not all-capable is not an pessimistic or self-refuting outlook; it enable us to focus on our strengths and avoid the issue of being short sighted by an unwarranted optimism. In the same fashion we have to fight for our dreams, there are times we should just give up.

The "you can do anything you apply your mind to" is a fluff, misguided notion, and perhaps an insult to the people who dedicates their lives to their dreams- _hey, I could be as good as you if I really wanted it_. If you have a passion, by all means, go ahead and give your darnest to it. But don't tell me being a Nobel-Pulitzer-Sculptor-Casanova Euler is a wish away.
