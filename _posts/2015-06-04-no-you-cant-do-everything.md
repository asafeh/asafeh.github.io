title: No, you can't do anything

There is a line of thinking among some people that says "anyone can do anything as long as one _really_ wants and dedicates oneself to it".

This is as dumb as _The Secret's_ idea.

It shouldn't be hard to see how wishful thinking it is: as wishful as detox diets, as eating an apple a day to cure cancer or setting up spells to catch a leprechaun. And why is it as rational as trying to catch an imaginary creature? Because for every person on Earth there exists abilities she can only imagine herself having it.

The proponents of this "we all can do anything" idea say that if you wish to do something you only need to either try and want it badly enough. However, what to say about a dwarf who dreams of running faster than Usain Bolt? An armless fellow who wants to swim as quickly as Michael Phelps? Or to use a more reasonable example, suppose a person who excels at math. Would she be able to win a Pulitzer, get a Nobel on peace and then paint a master piece? Of course not. It is hard to imagine someone well rounded at any field, let alone an expert at of them- no matter how hard they'd want it. And also exists a time constraint: when you are focused on your thing there's only so much room for n-ary activities- that's why bodybuilder scientists or mangaka philosophers are far and between. 

It is humbling to admit that there are things we suck and things we are good at. Saying otherwise is conceited and almost an insult to the people who dedicated their lives to their fields- _hey, I could be as good as you if I really wanted it_. If you have a passion, by all means go ahead and give your darnest to it. But don't tell me being a Nobel-Pulitzer-Painter Euler is a wish away.
