title: Evolution is just a theory

I get it- the _average person_ doesn't need to have an understanding of many and varied fields of knowledge. I certainly don't: I am clueless about, say, oceanography or the early history of aborigine societies. But there should exist a rule that says if you are going to pick on something, you should at least know the basics of it.

People _love_ to argue. To prove others wrong, show off their superior reasoning, carry an agenda, whatever the motive. However the amount of people who know jack shit about what they are talking about is staggering: in a blink of an eye, once they see a proposition, they become an expert in that subject, be it nail panting or astrophysics. Couple that with an unwillingness to actually understand the opposing arguments and you have the perfect debater (the perfect _real world_ debater where beliefs of opinion makers weight more than facts).

These professional argument-makers are everywhere trying to persuade you to their factual opinion. In everyday matters they are mildly uninteresting but in technical or scientific subjects they are downright hilarious. Pick any "controversial" theme: evolution, climate change, politics, braces vs indentation, etc. and they will appear to convince you that x is just a theory or how conspiracies lobbied your position. They have a problem with Big Pharma, the government, scientific consensus, everything that doesn't pander to their biases (interestingly enough, they don't have issues with the gravity _theory_ or government subsidies to their industries).

Albeit vocal, they are easy to spot and ignore; the real problem is that misinformation brings more misinformation: suddenly you have other people following them, especially when feelings are evoked in the listeners. The bad debaters are not always bad at debating- rather, most can appealingly present their case- they only strawman counterarguments. The public is so much more inclined to agree with somebody closer to them or their previously held beliefs; that's how we end up with Young Earth followers or climate change conservative deniers. And then it comes full circle, the before-listeners, now-debaters go out to spread more misguided information.
