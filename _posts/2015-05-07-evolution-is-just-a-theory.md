title: Evolution is just a theory

I get it- nobody needs, not it is feasible most of the time, to have an understanding of many and varied fields of knowledge. I certainly don't: I am clueless about, say, oceanography or the early history of aborigine societies. But there should exist a rule that says if you are going to pick on something, you should at least know the basics of it.

People love to argue. To prove others wrong, show off their superior reasoning, carry an agenda, whatever the motive. However the amount of people who know jack shit about what they are talking about is staggering: in a blink of an eye, once they see a proposition, they become an expert in that subject, be it nail panting or astrophysics. Couple that with an unwillingness to actually understand the opposing arguments and you have the perfect debater (that is, perfect _real world_ debater where beliefs of opinion makers weight more than facts).

These professional argument-makers are everywhere trying to persuade you of their factual opinions. In everyday matters they are mildly annoying but in technical or important subjects they are downright hysterical. Pick any "controversial" theme: climate change, politics, braces vs indentation, etc. and they will appear to convince you that x is just a theory or how conspiracies lobbied your position. They have a problem with Big Pharma, the government, scientific consensus, everything that doesn't pander to their biases (interestingly enough, they don't have issues with the gravity _theory_ or government subsidies to their industries). Albeit misguided, the bad debaters are not always bad at debating- rather, most can appealingly present their case- even if the actual substance of their message is ridicule of the opposing arguments or witty remarks- and evoke strong feelings in the listeners, who are naturally inclined to agree with somebody closer to them or their previously held beliefs. That's how we end up with Young (and Flat) Earth followers or climate change deniers.

The cherry in the cake is that it goes usually full circle: when enough times repeated, misconception causes so far listeners, now debaters to go out and spread more opinionated but mistaken informations.
