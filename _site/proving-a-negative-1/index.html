                       <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Atheism, contrary to the edgy teenagers, i.e., “smarting up” or religious fundamentalists, “being mad at God”, is, in essence, the rejection of a claim. Rather than affirm no god exists, atheism says that no definitive evidence has been presented. Well, that is how the saying goes- at least as far as religious people demand atheists to <em>prove</em> their negative. Pulling from totaly random samples such as youtube comments and facebook posts, it might go someway like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“God x or y”
<cite>says the theist</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Prove that God exists” 
<cite>replies the atheist</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Prove that God <em>doesn’t</em> exists” 
<cite>rejoinders the theist</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I think, as religion is so entrenched in our society and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9p5T6lbsc">no amount of explaining</a> will convince <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqNjebKc9rU"><em>some</em> folks</a> about the concept of extraordinary claims, is far more useful to answer the question than engage in discussions about burden of proof. Sure, it is impossible to disprove with 100% certainty a generic god who might exist in any crack of the universe, however, that is not who the god of major religions is: he is said to possess characteristics, take actions in the natural world, leave signs of his existence, etc. All of this can be tested or reasoned until practical certainty about his existence is achieved.</p>

<p>Take Christianity into consideration. As for what god does or is, there is, unsurprisingly, a whole book we can consult. Obviously, Christians uphold the Bible as the true word of God; Christian apologists employ an ingenious artifact: begin by “proving” the Bible and then use it to ascertain the existence of God- the “<a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-God-Word.html">argument</a> from <a href="http://www.lwf.org/site/News2?id=5276">the Bible</a>”, as Theodore Drange put it, which can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Bible is throughout coherent: the 66 books read as one, with no contradictions in its doctrines and teachings, even though being written over a long period of time and in different languages</li>
  <li>The Bible is scientifically accurate, despite being written so far ago, and its books are historical documents</li>
  <li>The Bible contains many fulfilled prophecies</li>
</ol>

<p>That is to say, using the argument’s same line of reasoning, if the Bible is shown to be flawed so is the idea of the Christian God. Let’s make a (somewhat) concise take of the argument from Bible- with the premises turned over, however.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Bible is incoherent and filled with errors.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16-17">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A12">Hebrews 4:12</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first argument in the list is the most heralded by Christian believers. They guarantee, context being respected, no contradiction will be found in the Bible. This is reasonable- actually, no one would expect less of a book written by an all-knowing being. As a matter of fact, one would expect a perfect book, direct, with no need or margin to interpretation, teachings and concepts not bound to particular nation or period in time, but universally applicable in any age. Even if it’s not the case with the Bible- shown by the mere fact you are reading this essay or how from the same book sprout several conflicting religions with several distinct sects- are there any clear mistakes in the scriptures? We’ll skip factual contradictions (you can see a list <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/101_bible_contradictions.htm">here</a>) and look only for logical or doctrinal inconsistencies.</p>

<p>a. <em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 2</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 3</a>: the fall of mankind</em></p>

<p>The principal tenet of the Christian faith is humanity’s sinful state and how <a href="http://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=11&amp;article=1331">through Jesus’ sacrifice we are able to turn again to God</a>. Nevertheless, how exactly did we fall from Grace in the first place? The biblical account is quite simple, despite left with some unanswered questions (e.g., we do not know how long it took from the creation to the fall or how would it have played if men had eaten from the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.3.22&amp;version=NIV">tree of life</a>, or even the <a href="http://www.eternalgod.org/q-a-9333/">details</a> of <a href="http://www.creators.com/lifestylefeatures/inspiration/kids-talk-about-god/what-would-it-be-like-if-adam-and-eve-hadn-t-eaten-the-forbidden-fruit.html">not eating</a> anything). Adam and Eve, pure and without <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.2.25&amp;version=NIV">malice</a>, lived in the perfect paradise of Eden, free of diseases, suffering or death. Ageless, able to communicate freely with God and having the earth at its disposal, men had only one rule to abide for: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.2.16-Gen.2.17&amp;version=NIV">not eat from the tree of good and evil</a>. However, tricked by the serpent, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.3.1-Gen.3.6&amp;version=NIV">Adam eats the fruit</a> and so all of us must face the consequences: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.3.24&amp;version=NIV">banishment from Eden</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.3.16&amp;version=NIV">the subject of women to men</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.3.17-Gen.3.19&amp;version=NIV">a cursed earth with phisical death</a>, and, above all, the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6:23">possibility</a> of eternal damnation in <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/why-does-God-send-people-to-hell.html">hell</a>.</p>

<p>This is nonsensical.</p>

<p>First off, how is Adam to blame for eating the fruit? Before doing so he did not even know there was a right and a wrong- this very concept dawned on him <em>after</em> he ate the fruit. One might also ask why did God need to <a href="http://www.sermonindex.net/modules/articles/index.php?view=article&amp;aid=23387">test</a> us anyway, but the more fundamental question is: why did God allowed in us the possibility of sinning? Different to what Christian theology says, sinning (or evil) is not a necessary result of <a href="http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/theodicy.html">free will</a>. If so, it would mean that God has no free will, given he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence">omnibevolent</a> (and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1.13&amp;version=NIV">cannot be tempted by evil or sin</a>). Since moral perfection is conciliable with personal choice, God could have created us in his true image- able to choose only from good options- so why set up men to fail and thereafter punish us if we rather exercise our “free will”? Then again, supposing God <a href="http://www.godsplanforlife.org/"><em>did have</em></a> to <a href="http://piecomic.tumblr.com/post/78680666729">test us</a>, what’s the reasoning behind judging all humanity through a single couple? Wouldn’t individual Tree-of-Knowledge like tests for every person be more fair?</p>

<p>Granted, we have some <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/30066/if-adam-and-eve-didnt-know-good-from-evil-how-can-we-say-they-sinned-accordin">mental gymnastics</a> to <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/God-allow-evil.html">try and make sense</a> of these issues, nevertheless, the absurdity persists- cerebral black flips or not- when we think the whole situation through God’s perspective. God is omniscient. That means he knew beforehand of humankind’s fall, their punishment, Jesus’ death on a cross <em>et al</em>. That is: to save humankind from God, because of a test he made, God sacrificed… himself. It is difficult to believe that is the handiwork of a supreme and all-knowing being.</p>

<p>b. <em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6-+genesis+9&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 6 to 9</a>: the Flood</em></p>

<p>The Flood is one of the most famous stories of the Bible: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6.5-+genesis+6.8&amp;version=NIV">humanity evil reaches such a point that God regrets making them and decides to wipe everyone out</a>, except for Noah’s family, who should build a ship to accomodate all species in the world. This passage could be as well under argument number 2 (scientific and historical accuracy), but it so perfectly make a case for the not-inspired view of the Bible that I will have it here. So we shall not dwell on the scientific accuracy of every animal in a wooden ship riding a global flood, as <a href="http://ncse.com/cej/4/1/impossible-voyage-noahs-ark">it was comprehensively made before</a>, or how, say, any parasite <a href="http://evolutionwiki.org/wiki/Parasites_pose_problems_for_the_ark">survived the flood</a>.</p>

<p>The mere inclusion of this story in the Bible is far more telling. Does any of the following strikes you as the penning of an eternal and omniscient author?</p>

<ul>
  <li>A story so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziusudra#Sumerian_flood_myth">close</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh">far</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atra-Hasis">older</a> myths that only minor details change,</li>
  <li>yet <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206&amp;version=NIV">transcibed</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%207&amp;version=NIV">in three</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%208&amp;version=NIV">different chapters</a> <a href="http://contradictionsinthebible.com/the-flood-narratives/">with conflicting facts</a>,</li>
  <li>in which the unique righteous family in the planet happens to live not in Iceland, Polinesia or South America, but in the only part of the world known to the people featured in the biblical narratives.</li>
</ul>

<p>c. <em>God and temptation</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1.13&amp;version=NIV">James 1:13</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we look into the passages which contradict the verse above, let’s read some Christian apologists on this issue. The key parts, excerpted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But is testing identical to tempting? For example, let’s say God wants to test someone’s honesty and puts them in a room with a lost wallet. Is this tempting? I think not. To truly tempt, God would have to whisper, “Pick it up, keep it, no one will know, etc.” No clear contradictions here.
<a href="http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/Bible.htm#19">http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/Bible.htm#19</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we mostly use the term tempt specifically to mean to “solicit to do evil.” However, the term has not always been quite so narrowly interpreted. In the Bible this word conveys that idea at times, but at other times it means to “put to the test.” The context helps to determine which meaning is intended.
<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/who-is-god/god-is-good/can-god-be-tempted/">https://answersingenesis.org/who-is-god/god-is-good/can-god-be-tempted/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citations have something in common which we’ll see many times: the necessity to find a particular meaning of a word which paints the text in some (remember, the <a href="http://www.gospelway.com/Bible/interpretation-Bible.php"><em>correct</em></a>) shade and tip toe around passages to make what we read divinely inspired- even if all seems to appoint to a limited knowledge, wholly human author. Here, in the conflict between James’ teaching and God’s actions regard temptation, is no different:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!”</p>

  <p>“Here I am,” he replied.</p>

  <p>Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love-Isaac-and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+22%3A1-2&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 22:1-3</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”</p>

  <p>So the king said to Joab and the army commanders with him, “Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are.”</p>

  <p>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.”</p>

  <p>Before David got up the next morning, the word of the Lord had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer: “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’”</p>

  <p>So Gad went to David and said to him, “Shall there come on you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.”</p>

  <p>David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+24%3A1-2&amp;version=New-International-Version-NIV-Bible">2 Samuel 24:1-2</a><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+24%3A10-14&amp;version=NIV">, 10-14</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:1-11">Matthew 4:1</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all these passages we have clear examples (you can read the rest of the chapters for the context) of God presenting someone the chance to do evil (i.e., testing, tempting). However, there exits one where he directly changes someone’s disposition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said to Moses.
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+9:12">Exodus 9:12</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wording here is specific in stating that God himself made Pharaoh not listen to Moses’ request- which prompted more plagues for the Egyptians, including the death of the first born, and, ultimately, the Red Sea flooding. The apostle Paul comments on it later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A16-18&amp;version=NIV">Romans 9:16-18</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, there are of course <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aiia/aiia-pharaoh.html">countless</a> <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/God-harden-Pharaoh-heart.html">attempts</a> <a href="http://www.apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=11&amp;article=1205">to justificate</a> these passages- which raises the question: how many external clarifications does the perfect word of Good need?</p>

<p>d. <em>Made in God’s image</em></p>

<p>The Bible claims God is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. The first chapter of the first book, <em>Genesis</em>, tells we were made in God’s image. A closer reading of the rest shows otherwise, though- God, with his mood swings, inconsistent back and forths with his creation and constant need of praise seems made instead to fit man’s very image. Like most of us, the God in the Bible possess varied and conflicting emotions: he feels anger and anguish, also love and compassion, decides but goes back later on, or sometimes has a need for acknowledgement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever.

<blockquote>
  <p>And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In the same vein, like you and me, God has preferences and, sometimes, <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/why-God-choose-Israel.html">favorites</a>- despite what <em>The Epistle to the Romans</em> might <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2:11&amp;version=NIV">say</a>. The Old Testament, which is nothing but the tale of God’s musings with the Earth, consists of a long exposition of what God <a href="http://therefinersfire.org/original_commandments1.htm">likes</a> and whom he prefers: from the entire world, God exclusively chose a tiny nation in the middle east, Israel, which, through God’s miraculous power- only acessible to them- massacred their way into the promised land. Even so, God still had <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A13&amp;version=NIV">some</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32%3A10&amp;version=NIV">favorites</a> amongst his chosen people.</p>

<p>He also has some quirks. In one of the best books of the Old Testament, <em>Job</em>, God <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A8&amp;version=NIV">shows off his faithfull servant</a> to Satan and they enter <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A8-12&amp;version=NIV">in a bet of sorts</a> in which Job loses his <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A13-22&amp;version=NIV">children and all his possessions</a>. Amidst his <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A13-22&amp;version=NIV">suffering</a>, Job engages in a long debate with 3 of his friends (4, if you count the one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elihu_%28Job%29">out of the blue</a>) about whether upright people face evil or suffer infortunies. Job affirms that God does <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+9:22-23&amp;version=NIV">fault innocent and wicked alike</a> whilst the friends insist that it <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+4%3A7&amp;version=NIV">never happens</a> and, therefore, Job had sinned to deserve such ill fate. By the end of the book, as Job monologues and the friends tire of dissuading his innocence plead, God appears in a storm and settles the matter by stating <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+38-+job+40&amp;version=NIV">he does whatever he wants, to whomever he wants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Bible historicity and science are fable based</strong></p>

<p>The miracles and happenings in the Bible appeal more to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy">Bible inerrancy</a> crowd. Some Christians might derive meaning from only the “spiritual” teachings in the Bible, however fundamentalists believe that if any point in the Bible is incorrect, it might just be all incorrect. Unfortunately, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">leads</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_healing">serious cases</a> of denial of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition">reality</a>.</p>

<p><em>a. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 1</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 2</a>: the creation of the universe</em></p>

<p>Right off the bat, there are several problems in how to interpret the Bible’s account on the formation of the universe. How God made it, commanding into existence light, vegetation, animals and everything else, is widely known. However, reading the two first chapters we see there are actually two creation narratives: in the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.20-Gen.1.26&amp;version=NIV">chapter one God makes plants, animals then male and female humans</a>, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.2.7-Gen.2.19&amp;version=NIV">chapter two he makes man, plants and animals, then a woman</a>. Well, we can say that, very much like cakes and icings, the two chapters complete each other if we go by some <a href="https://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=6&amp;article=1131">explanations</a>. Then, the following outline of creation ensues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>God creates the heavens and earth (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.1-Gen.1.2&amp;version=NIV"><em>Genesis</em> 1:1-2</a>)</li>
  <li>God creates light (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.3-Gen.1.5&amp;version=NIV"><em>Genesis</em> 1:3-5</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p>Since the claim is the Bible as a perfect historical account, could a literal, face-value meaning work here? The answer may be yes- but only if we <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/">bend science</a> to accommodate the text. The most glaring problem with Genesis’ myth of creation is that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Chronology">formation of the universe</a>, earth and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life">development of life</a> <em>did not</em> <a href="http://thinking-critically.com/2010/08/15/everything-in-science-ok-much-of-science-made-easy/">take six literal, 24 hours days</a>. And even using a <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/genesis.html">different interpretation</a> by saying the days are undetermined long periods of time, several incorrect facts persist. For example, according to Genesis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Earth existed before stars or the very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud">molecular clouds</a> who formed both of them (stars only appear on day 4, no other celestial body is ever mentioned)</li>
  <li>There was light in the Earth before the Sun, or any other stars, existed (light is created on day one, stars on day 4)</li>
  <li>Daylight and moonlight come from two different sources (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.16&amp;version=NIV"><em>Genesis</em> 1:16</a>)</li>
  <li>Plants existed before the required sunlight to make photosynthesis (Sun and stars are created a day later than vegetation)</li>
  <li>Flower bearing plants existed before any insects were present to do pollination (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.12&amp;version=NIV"><em>Genesis</em> 1:12</a>)</li>
  <li>Birds appeared before land animals (they are created on day 5 together with sea life)</li>
  <li>Humanity descended from Adam and Eve, however the existing human genetic diversity could not have come from <a href="http://biologos.org/blog/does-genetics-point-to-a-single-primal-couple">only a couple</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, a scientifically accurate, historical literal meaning is not going to work. Well, another interpretation is one of a poetic or metaphorical meaning: Genesis 1 and 2 are not to be taken at face value, rather the important message is <em>who</em> created the universe, not <em>how</em>. That sounds reasonable, even if it flies in the face of usual claims such as <a href="http://www.gospelway.com/Bible/interpretation-Bible.php">“the Bible has only one ‘correct’ interpretation”</a>, or make some passages seem more <a href="https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/689-does-the-Bible-contain-contradictions">“perfect”</a> than others.</p>

<p><em>.b Astronomy</em></p>

<p>Whenever skeptics point out scientific issues in the Bible- as in the case of the next passages- one of the first things Bible literalists object is: <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c016.html">“God can do it since he’s ominipotent”</a>(no matter how preposterous a claim, given <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Superman-No-Limits-DC-Comics/dp/1563896990">unlimited power</a>, nothing is too difficult). Sometimes they come up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Noahs-Ark-A-Feasibility-Study/dp/0932766412">creative</a> <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/how-could-noah-fit-the-animals-on-the-ark-and-care-for-them/">explanations</a> of how would God perform these miracles or allege the use a so-called <a href="http://creation.com/joshuas-long-day">“language of appearance”</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the Lord in the presence of Israel:</p>

  <p>“Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”</p>

  <p>So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar.</p>

  <p>The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. 14 There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the Lord listened to a human being. Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel!
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+10%3A12-14&amp;version=NIV">Joshua 10:12-14</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The text here do not seem to warrant the creative explanations such as long fights or lighting tricks. However, as to what really happened in such passage, what seems more likely? a) God actually stopped the Earth’s rotation (which would be correct, despite Joshua’s request to stand the Sun and Moon still) with several miracles to prevent: Israel (and the rest of the planet) from launching into orbit (as for inertia they’d be still moving) and high speed winds, coupled with gigantic tsunamis, leveling us flat (Or in the case he did it gradually, i.e., not a sudden deceleration, still several miracles to protect the half side of the Earth exposed to sun, the lack of magnetic field, etc.). Then, afterwards the battle, some more miracles to put everything back in order- just to make the Amorites’ slaughter, led by Joshua, more convenient. b) Joshua’s ignorance about physics and aptitude for exaggeration.</p>

<p>However, God changes nature for not only Joshua, but also a second time to serve as a sign to Hezekiah:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘This is the Lord’s sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised: I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down
<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+38%3A7-8&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah 38:7-8</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again, one can conclude that <em>Isaiah</em>’s writer took inspiration in <em>Joshua</em> or that <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/God-works-in-mysterious-ways.html">standard Christian theology</a> applies here as well.</p>

<p><em>.c Historicity</em></p>

<p>The New Testament is riddled with unsupported accounts and flat-out made up stories. The unsupported claims are easy to guess: Jesus’ miracles, his resurrection, etc. The made up stories, however, constitute of much what Christians would consider history.</p>

<p>For example, in the episode of the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%205:1%E2%80%9320;&amp;version=NIV">Garasene</a>, where Jesus expels demons into pigs, the location (Gerasa in the <em>Gospel of Mark</em>, Gadara in the <em>Gospel of Matthew</em>) is nowhere near the sea for the pigs fell a cliff and drown in it (Gesara is 50km away from the Sea of Galilee, Gadara is 10km); there is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barabbas">record of a custom of freeing one prisoner in Passover</a>; the Gospels are not consistent among themselves in <a href="http://www.evilbible.com/contradictions.htm">many of their accounts</a>.</p>

<p>In the same spirit, Jesus’ early life, as recorded in the Gospels, is mostly fabricated to confirm messianic prophecies. In the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV"><em>Gospel of Luke</em></a>, Joseph travels to Bethlehem to attend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius">Census of Quirinus</a>, however the census was only for Judaea citizens- Joseph lived in Galilee- and the demand for returning to the birthplace alleged by Luke hardly makes any sense for a tax census, where property would be linked to its owners. Luke also says that the birth of John the Baptist was <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A26&amp;version=NIV">few months before Jesus’</a>, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A5&amp;version=NIV">the time of Herod</a>, but there are 10 years between the death of Herod (4 BCE) and the Census of Quirinus (6 CE). Likewise, <em>The Gospel of Matthew</em> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2%3A1&amp;version=NIV">places the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem</a>, albeit with no mention to the census, and claims that Joseph and Mary fled to Egypt because of, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents">also fictional</a>, Herod’s order to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2%3A13-18&amp;version=NIV">kill all infants</a>. Most likely, Luke and Matthew accounts of the birthplace were invented to confirm (what they think of as) an Old Testament prophecy in the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+5%3A2&amp;version=NIV"><em>Book of Micah</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it turns out that the <em>Old Testament</em>, which the gospel writers took their prophecies from, is, most likely, also fabricated. Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible#Historicity_of_events_in_Ancient_Israel_and_Judah">not mentioning</a> miracles or supernatural sightings, most of the Old Testament stories have little to none evidence and <a href="http://www.news24.com/MyNews24/The-Problem-of-the-Bible-Inaccuracies-contradictions-fallacies-scientific-issues-and-more-20120517">are never cited in any documents besides the Bible</a>: the Exodus, conquest of Canaan, Davidic empire, and other well known old Israel’s stories are all big claims completely unsuported by any <a href="http://www.theaunicornist.com/2012/01/bogus-historicity-of-old-testament.html">archeological finding</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. All prophecies in the Bible are flawed</strong></p>

<p>This is where Bible apologists get creative. The passages supposed to be prophecies are either not prophecies at all, “fulfilled” in the same book or such loose socks of wording any foot of event could fit them.</p>

<p><em>a. Messianic prophecies</em></p>

<p>There are said to exist over <a href="http://www.accordingtothescriptures.org/prophecy/353prophecies.html">300 prophecies</a> about the Messiah, Jesus. Barring the obvious problem that we have no guarantees (archaeological, historical, etc.) that any biblical narrative actually took place, the messianic prophecies are akin to try and fit two different stories, say, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/"><em>Downfall</em></a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg"><em>Kung Fury</em></a>. Some parts may add up (they both have a character named Hitler), however some others employ quite a bit of shoehorning (Hitler traveled time before his death? Well, It could be said so, where is the body?).</p>

<p>Take for instance prophecies such as: the Messiah would be born of a woman (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 3:15</a>), the Messiah would come from the line of Abraham (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2012:3&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 12:3</a>) or the Messiah would be a prophet (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018:15&amp;version=NIV">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>). These are not remarkable- if they can be called “prophecies” at all. What about any of these verses, all listed as part of the amazing prophecies about Christ, sounds foretelling or could be said as specific to Jesus?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.”

<cite><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:2&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 8:2</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tendency continues with either prophecies said to be fulfilled by the New Testament authors which <em>are not</em> in the Old Testament (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2%3A23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 2:23</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+7:38&amp;version=NIV">John 7:38 </a>), or severe reinterpretation of Old Testament passages. Some of most glaring are in the <em>Book of Isaiah</em>. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53&amp;version=NIV">The suffering servant</a> is said to predict the life and passion of Christ. However the text is talking about Israel, not a Messiah, as Isaiah <a href="http://outreachjudaism.org/gods-suffering-servant-isaiah-53/">call his nation a “suffering servant” several times</a>, as well in the other Servant Songs, which <em>Isaiah 53</em> is the forth. Isaiah is also misread in relation to the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+7:14&amp;version=NIV">virgin birth</a>- the word “Almah” in the Tenakh is better understood as “young woman”, if the distinction mattered, Isaiah could use the specific word, “Betulah”. It doesn’t even make any sense: in <em>Isaiah 7</em> God says he will use a birth as a sign of salvation for Ahaz, in his lifetime, not a future incident. <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_prophecies#Non-prophecies">All prophecies about “facts” in the life of Jesus are in this fashion</a>.</p>

<p>In the end, there is no specific foreshadowing about the person of Christ as described the <em>New Testament</em>. When the Old Testament does tell about a Messiah, it refers to a <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm">politician and military commander</a>, which can hardly be said about Jesus.</p>

<p><em>b. Reinterpretation of prophecies</em></p>

<p>Reissuing of prophetic meaning is not exclusive to messianic prophecies.</p>

<p>The rapture- <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/end.html">Jesus’ second coming</a>- and the subsequent end of the world, have had to be rethought a lot of times since Christ’s first visit. The early church expected his return within a generation from his death.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

<blockquote>
  <p>Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.

</blockquote>

<p>Of course this has not happened; the world is still here, as ever. This prompted some Christians to reinterpret the prophecies in the <em>Book of Daniel</em> and <em>Revelation</em> as events which took place in the first and second centuries- the so called <em><a href="http://www.bible.ca/pre-mt24-this-generation.htm">preterists</a></em>. Some preterists disagree with the notion of a physical second coming, saying it was fulfilled with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. However, such a view do not sit right with most Christians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_and_claims_for_the_Second_Coming_of_Christ">some even tried their hands in pinpointing the exact date</a>) and so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming_%28LDS_Church%29">several</a> interpretations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_eschatology">ranging</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism_%28Christianity%29">“some of it is historical, some not”</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism_%28Christianity%29">“it will be fulfilled in the future”</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism_%28Christian_eschatology%29">“it’s all symbolism”</a> have appeared along history. It’s hard to say which one is <em>accurate</em>, nevertheless, I think it’s safe to say that most Christians believe the end of the world to happen somewhen in the future.</p>

<p>What the various shapes of its-gonna-happen-someday eschatology have in common is the <em>signs</em> of Christ return. Again, these prophecies have been reworked as the world changes. First, we have generic statements that could be said of <a href="http://www.whatchristianswanttoknow.com/biblical-signs-of-the-second-coming-of-jesus-christ/">any time in history</a> such as increase of immorality, theft or murder, or famines; earthquakes and other natural disasters, etc. Then, some <a href="https://www.raptureready.com/abc/magog.html">pretty</a> farfetched <a href="http://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/seven-prophecies-that-must-be-fulfilled-before-jesus-christs-return">interpretations</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For some strange reason (perhaps the same which lead people to believe <a href="http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Bible-Verses-About-Nuclear-Weapons/">this</a> to be clairvoyance of atomic weapons) “no one” in the text above is said to be “the whole world”, thus nuclear bombs, thus Jesus couldn’t have come back before last century, since we didn’t have any way to destroy the entire globe yet. In the same vein, Jesus is said to prophesize the Jewish establishment in 1948:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.  For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.

<p>These, and all the countless end of the world prophecies, will never be “wrong”: you and I won’t be here in the distant future, however they will simply be shifted to mean something that makes sense at the time.</p>

He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons. His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the warhorses, wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through. The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea. I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more. I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets.

  <p>The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry.</p>

  <p>The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither, also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river. Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away and be no more.</p>

  <p>The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away.

<p>Another prophecy to bully the Egypt, however there exists no evidence that the Nile has ever completely dried up.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I believe the given points- albeit many more could be made- should be enough to “prove” atheist (with relation to the biblical God). Of course, if the argument is with someone who cannot understand how extraordinary their claim is, no amount of reasoning will suffice, but in the very least it should serve as exercise.</p>
