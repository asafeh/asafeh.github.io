title: Proving a negative, Part 3- The argument from personal experience
--- 

**Introduction**

[Resuming](http://www.azafeh.com/2015/11/27/proving-a-negative-2.html) our atheist quest, and in the spirit of previous time, let's confront some other commonly put forward theism arguments.

**Miracles**

Nearly every religion on the planet enlists miracles as positive evidence of their creed. However, in the world of faith, truly extraordinary events, such as opening the sea or flying away in winged horses, belong either to the past (in the form of sacred texts or tradition) or to the future (the afterlife or the judgement of the world). If one looks closer, it's patent that by miracles religious believers actually mean "unlikely but naturally possible events", such as the cure of a serious disease, how a situation was unexpected reverted, etc., and not what one would expect if able to tap from the unlimited supernatural fountain. Whatever rationalization a religion might provide for its not-so-special miracle work, the obvious conclusion is that supernaturally caused extraordinary events, in fact, do not happen. 

This makes the spiritual entities seem petty (or not so powerful), however the usual religious kind of miracles have better natural rather than supernatural explanations, as well. Spontaneous regression of cancer does not make a great case for miracles if from millions of the ill a few are cured. When a thousand of people pray and only one is heard, miracles becomes indistinguishable from chance. The same for otherwise fatal accidents: from all the people who asked deliverance from God or gods, how many, for example, survived a plane crash? The failure cases seem to not come into the equation. Prayers, rituals, postive thinking, reiki, what have you, always fail to show realible efficacy of otherwordly powers in any large sized sample. Such constatation alone should suffice to reject any personal anecdote which mistake coincidences for the supernatural, but we have still another issue: how a supernatural entity divides its miracles. The idea that minor incidents, such as stolens objects or the need to pay certain bills, are granted miracles but millions of people starve or suffer through their lives unattended is, quite frankly, immoral. Nevertheless, this fazes no believer; they continue to loudly boast their achievements brought by miracles- even if it is how God gave them a house which they pay loan each month or healead them after a medical treatment was followed.

**Supernatural presence**

Supernatural experiences are the "don't knock it till you try it" of the theist world. People feel the Holy Ghost, are conforted by guardian spirits, have all kinds of Ayahuasca induced frenzies- thus intuitively knowing in "their hearts" that the supernatural exists. That is indeed an interesting distinction. Whereas there are religious apologists, the majority of people have not reasoned about the factuality of their beliefs, and if asked to justify it, they will not appeal to philosophical arguments or pull up empirical evidences, they will just say they _feel it_. 

Despite the possibility of offense- they might think being called liars- and as much as the feelings and experiences are very real, so is their source natural. Several activities can cause an altered state of consciousness: drugs (or placebos passed as drugs), meditation, sleep deprivation, oxygen deprivation, [sensory deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation), physical exercicies, fasting, [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29), traumas, diseases... because, at the end of the day, the brain is subject to chemical reactions as any other organ.
