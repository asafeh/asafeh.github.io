Have you ever shared (or sympathized with) one of those memes saying "It is finally Friday!", "When you wake up and realize it is Friday"? If so, we need to talk about ideology.

-----------------------

Weasel words aside, it is fair to say that most like the concept of freedom or liberty. Individuals should be free, speech should be free; the land we live, the world we are part of is free -- you get the idea. But what if we took this idea to the extreme, and thought of some hardcore liberty-ness, the most ever imaginably possible free folk living in a free as in freedom world?

Well, let's take a step back and first conceive what "freedom" should be about. Rather boringly, Merriam Webster defines the word liberty as

* the quality or state of being free:
        a) the power to do as one pleases
        b) freedom from physical restraint
        c) the positive enjoyment of various social, political, or economic rights and privileges
        d) the power of choice

The common feature here seems to be a lack of interference: there is no one limiting my choices; nothing stopping me from enjoying or doing things. We could imagine then someone living all alone in total isolation -- hey what could be more free? There is no one about to tell that person off, or boss them around. But how many choices does that person really have (remember, we want to have all at max here)? After all, to live you need food, water (probably sex too) and the like which all require work. Doing all that by yourself seem to leave little time for anything else, if we are counting any of the so called "higher callings" of living. Our hermit would probably have access to more possibilities if he lived in a society of sorts. After all someone could take of part of the work, someone else of some other part, maybe exchange some goods? (could flirt with the locals) and "hey whats that thing that that guy invented?".

So the most free of situations entails living as a group of some sort. Can we talk about memes again? Well, not yet.

Definition a) seems in line with what we have so far, but we may reword definition d) to better match our current understanding of freedom: power of, and as well access to, choice.

But the thing with society is that, well, there is a bunch of people. These are different and have different intentions, whats stopping one of them from restricting the freedom of someone else? Or a group of them imposing rules on another group? There is also the fact that if everyone's freedom are to be maximized, then no one person should have special powers over the rest.

Well, I grant that these questions are very difficult to answer. There is however, one easy bit that follows from definition b) given above: _freedom to hurt other is no freedom at all_. If a person is causing harm to another person, that other person's freedom is not being maximized: thus the ability to cause harm cannot be a choice. That's one restriction that actually makes things less restrictive (besides being bloody obvious). By harm we can readily include obvious things like murder, rape and etc, but we will soon see how prejudice is also another form harm takes. That being said, for those of you accompanying home, b) becomes freedom from physical restraint and harm.

But we if go back to the Friday memes (finally), it seems there is something more insidious at play -- after all, there is nothing physically preventing the memer from just leaving their office or whatever holds them until the weekend. Centaining (well, unless slaves are now posting memes) no one is also picking people off the streets, whipping them to a chair and only allowing them exit on Friday.

What gives then? The memer (to be honest, your lame aunt sharing stuff on facebook can be hardly called a memer) has an indirect threat prevent them: if they stopped working, they would have no money, if they had no money, they would have no food, if they had no food, they would have no energy, if they had no energy, the mitocrondia wouldn't be the powerhouse of the cell... cutting things short: meaningfully, it is not a choice: either a person makes money or suffers starvation, homelessness and all around being destitute. Is our definition of freedom not comprehensive enough?

By that same logic, there is one guideline we can follow, if we are maximizing our freedom business here: everyone affected by x should have a say in x. If a situation involves 5 people in some way, then these five people have equal decision power. If it affects a neighbourhood, then the neighbourhood will decide it. If the city, then the city; if the universe; then the goddamned universe. That sounds dangerously similar to democracy, is there even a difference? Well, imagined if you applied it to _everything_: the local neighbourhood association, the local policy deparatment, the ministry of education, the rules regarding fishing. Thats a lot more power than your average person has currently.

Then, by definition, this also includes whatever work a person does. Remember how we need basic things to expand our array of choices? Well, guess what where basic things come from? That is right, work. The only way to have your true, unbased freedom is to be _entitled_ to basic needs. That was quite a detour, but we can finally rewrite defintion c) equal participation power in all social, politicial, economic areas.

So what was the point of all this? How does the title of video ties with this all? Why did you watch this whole thing? What I described is called _anarchism_. It turns out that a free society is one free of hierarchies. It turns out it was leftist prograganda along.
