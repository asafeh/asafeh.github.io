title: The incorrect religion

Riding the wave from [last time](http://www.azafeh.com/correct-religion/), I found not only a single article, but a whole trend on the internet. Whereas religious fundamentalists might be confused about pressing- or more concrete- issues such as gay or women rights, atheists are tied up in knots over imaginary definitions, who is more tecnicaly correct or plain wrong arguments. Take for instance the definition of atheism: "position that no gods exist". It looks rather simple on a initial glance, however [Internet](http://www.atheistberlin.com/) Atheists [have](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=6487) made it [into](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/ub9om/to_ignostics_walk_me_through_your_ideas/) a [detailed](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/3ghlpd/the_agnosticgnostictheistatheist_chart/) and [charged](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1m5fll/can_gnostic_atheism_be_justified/) web of [terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/5vhxzm/is_the_gnostic_position_an_irrational_position/). Even non contentious ideas like "one should back up their claims" [are](http://www.secularrights.com/atheismisthedefaultposition.html) very [controversial](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=597) amongst [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3aVhJTvKM). Last but not least, Internet Atheists are [rationalism](https://www.quora.com/If-you-cannot-prove-a-negative-how-can-atheists-prove-Santa-Claus-unicorns-fairies-etc-does-not-exist) queens, [pure](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/new-theory-of-life-could-prove-how-life-began-and-disprove-god-10070114.html) beings of logic, [whose](https://godisimaginary.com/i4.htm) sole [source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-stenger/showing-god-does-not-exis_b_3757729.html) of [knowlegdge](http://atheistfoundation.org.au/article/critical-relevance-scientific-atheism-modern-world/) is the glorious [scientific method](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/06/03/a-quite-long-review-of-edward-fesers-aquinas-a-beginners-guide/). Seriously, just look at their websites, the words "rational", "thinking" or something to the same effect is always there like a stamp of the only true way to be an inteligent person.
