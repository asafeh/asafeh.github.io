title: Proving a negative, Part 2- The classic arguments for God
tags: [religion]
--- 

**Introduction**

[Resuming](http://www.azafeh.com/2015/11/12/proving-a-negative-1.html) our intent to "prove" atheism, let's take a look at some of the classical theist arguments. Instead of tackling a specific religion, like in the previous article, I will talk about an eternal, good-and-supreme deity- which is nevertheless present in many believe systems- as said arguments are used by proponents of many different religions. The main classic arguments are: [argument from first cause](http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/the-cosmological-argument/) (championed by [William Lane Craig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKavDdRVIg)), [argument from design](http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/design.htm) (championed by [Ray Comfort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXLqDGL1FSg)), [argument from morality](http://www.existence-of-god.com/moral-argument.html) (championed by... [Matt Dilahunty](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=matt+dillahunty+morality)?). And, as a bonus, we'll examine a more recent apologetic line of "thought": presuppositional apologetics.

However, it should be stressed that the need for these arguments is, in my opinion, a failure for the theist side: if God existed, it simply would be obvious. The correct religion wouldn't follow the gaps of scientific knowledge to place its deity, or try and make fancy philosophical mumbo jumbos; an omnipotent, wholly good supernatural being, who is concerned with human affairs, as proposed by religion, would make himself self-evident- lest be unfair and send unadvised people to condemnation and no longer be "wholly good".

* The argument from first cause: the beginning of universe must have an uncaused cause, that is, God

This argument, also known as the cosmological argument, is impressive- if you live in the 13th century. But in the words of William Craig:

>Perhaps the New Atheists think that the traditional arguments for God's existence are now passé and so no longer need refutation. If so, they are naïve. Over the last generation there has been a revival of interest among professional philosophers, whose business it is to think about difficult metaphysical questions, in arguments for the existence of God. This resurgence of interest has not escaped the notice of even popular culture. In 1980 Time ran a major story entitled "Modernizing the Case for God," which described the movement among contemporary philosophers to refurbish the traditional arguments for God's existence.

>The New Atheists are blissfully ignorant of this ongoing revolution in Anglo-American philosophy. They are generally out of touch with cutting-edge work in this field.

So where is the revolution and the "cutting edge work" done in favor of theistic arguments? You may read any article (including the one this excerpt belongs to) or watch any video from Dr. Craig and he will make the same tired syllogism:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.

2. The universe began to exist.

3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.

And talk _ad nauseum_ about what constitutes a good argument:

>Well, let's look at some of those arguments and see. But before we do, let's get clear what makes for a "good" argument. An argument is a series of statements (called premises) leading to a conclusion. A sound argument must meet two conditions: (1) it is logically valid (i.e., its conclusion follows from the premises by the rules of logic), and (2) its premises are true. If an argument is sound, then the truth of the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. But to be a good argument, it's not enough that an argument be sound. We also need to have some reason to think that the premises are true. A logically valid argument that has, wholly unbeknownst to us, true premises isn't a good argument for the conclusion. The premises have to have some degree of justification or warrant for us in order for a sound argument to be a good one. But how much warrant? The premises surely don't need to be known to be true with certainty (we know almost nothing to be true with certainty!). Perhaps we should say that for an argument to be a good one the premises need to be probably true in light of the evidence. I think that's fair, though sometimes probabilities are difficult to quantify. Another way of putting this is that a good argument is a sound argument in which the premises are more plausible in light of the evidence than their opposites. You should compare the premise and its negation and believe whichever one is more plausibly true in light of the evidence. A good argument will be a sound argument whose premises are more plausible than their negations.

What, in turn, will prompt the same answer: the argument is bogus from various standpoints. Starting with logic (that Will seems to hold so dearly) going all the way up to Cosmology:
 
>Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
 
The argument advocates an _ex nihilo_ beginning of the universe, with a cause outside of it, however that's not the kind of cause that "everything" has. Whatever we find in nature is a _transformation_ of preexisting things, not a magical onset. For example, birth is not an "initial cause"- the matter composing a new organism is simply an rearrangement caused by natural process which can be traced a long way back to the Big Bang: the heavier elements present in the organism were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis, the stars were previously molecular clouds, the hydrogen in the clouds are a product of the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the Big Bang was... ? That brings the second premise.
 
>The universe began to exist.
 
This is pure speculation. There's no clear understanding of the conditions during the singularity or before, and that is the folly of this argument: the use of common sense and "philosophical" reasoning in science (and to make matters worse, a not yet fully explained area of science). This only invites nonsensical results: in pretty much every scientific subject, specially the ones far away from human perception (e.g.: Quantum Mechanics, Hyperspace Topology, etc.), common sense is virtually useless. To exemplify it, Thunderf00t beautifully [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u6Mz21jTaA) a William Lane Craig style of argumentation to disprove Einstein’s Theory of Relativity:
 
1. Objects pushed forward move faster
 
2. A can of spam is an object 
  
3. A can of spam travelling at light speed pushed forward will move faster than light speed
 
>Therefore, the universe has a cause.
 
The conclusion, which assumes God, can't follow either. There are no basis to say that the "cause" of the universe (if it exists) is a personal being. And also the cosmological proponents have yet to show in a satisfactory manner why God does not need a cause. 
  
That's why this argument is only impressive if you are a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas. Many gaps in the scientific knowledge could only be explained by the supernatural; today we know it is just a matter of time (see: every etiological myth) until a natural explanation comes along.  
 
* The argument from design: the painting is evidence of the painter

The argument from design claims a so-called _fine tuning_ of the universe: the conditions for life are narrow to the point any change renders it impossible, thus implying a design, as it is too unlikely to have arisen by change. The famous science denier Frank Turek lists in his book _I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist_ 15 such conditions: 

1. Oxygen level on Earth

2. Atmospheric transparency of the Earth

3. Moon-Earth gravitational interaction

4. Carbon Dioxide level

5. Gravity

6. Centrifugal force

7. Rate of expansion of the universe

8. Speed of light

9. Water vapor levels in the atmosphere 

10. Jupiter gravitational field

11. Earth's crust

12. Earth's rotation

13. Axis tilt of the Earth

14. Atmospheric discharge

15. Seismic activity

The Theory of Intelligent Design (ID) is one of the efforts to science-y the fine-tuning claims. ID allegates an _irreducible complexity_ in living organisms, i.e., the components of life are so complex and interconnected that their step by step evolution is impossible (ID does not explicitly mention the _designer_ but since it is a theory by Christians for Christians, we can all guess who he is...).
One of most iconic proponents of ID is Ray Comfort. He and sidekick Kirk Cameron like to employ guerrilla tactics: approach lay people on the street and get a kick out of the cases the interviewees (unsurprisingly) don't know the finer details of evolutionary biology or Cosmology.


However, like the previous argument, the argument from design is only compelling in case of (willful, in the case of Ray or Turek) lack of knowledge- otherwise, even an amateurish understanding of science can make quick work of it. For starters, the universe is not life friendly: [95% of it](http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/) is composed of inhabitable Dark Energy or Dark Matter. The overwhelming majority of remaining 5% is hydrogen and helium- [heavier elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element#Abundance), which make up life, are only a tiny fraction. And for these living organisms the laws of nature are a constant death threat: massive collisions, [stars running out of fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Future), even plain bitchy [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) and many other "finely tuned" aspects of the universe might just undo millennium of life. On the other hand, the argument's claim is also misleading. Reconsider Turek's list: only 4 of its items are actual constants (speed of light, centrifugal and gravitational forces, rate of expansion); most of the remaining items are simply the way life affected Earth- go back far enough in time and the Earth wouldn't have any oxygen, atmosphere or a Moon in the sky- those hardly are constants. Furthermore, the constants Turek got right also add nothing to the argument: no one knows how many configurations (i.e., changing or getting rid) of fundamental forces or particles are feasible- it could even be that physical model of our universe is the only one possible. Simply put, the argument from design has it the other way: if the universe were different, life would just be different.

Its prettier formulation, Intelligent Design, is a field trip of biases and pseudoscience. Even their analogies are bad. ID proponents are fond of comparing inanimate objects with living organisms, saying, for example, "if you took a turn in the woods and saw Mount Rushmore, would you think nature carved the faces by chance?" or "no one upon finding a watch would think the parts self-assembled". Rather than an actual theory, as it is a tactic to spread religious ideologies and push away "evil science", ID strives on misrepresentation and a weird conception that disproving competing ideas proves yours- which can only fly with science illiterate people. In the examples above, mountains or clocks can't reproduce-well, no genetic variation- thus biological evolution is impossible. Ray Comfort also has a pet evidence: "the building is 100% scientific proof of a builder". Unfortunately for him, we know buildings don't occur naturally and one can actually meet and talk to a builder, alas not in the case of God. Evolution is a scientific consensus because it is [sustented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent) by [piles](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/) and [piles](http://evolutionfaq.com/articles/five-proofs-evolution) of evidence and sufficiently explains the biodiversity- not because it is some sort of dogma, or biologists have an agenda to push.    

* The argument from morality: there exists objective morality, independent from human opinions, which can be only explained if a wholly moral God set the moral code

>You are a New Zealander descendant from the first Polynesians who settled in the country. In a certain night, you have a vision of Io, the long forgotten supreme Maori God, who commands you to raise an army and take back all the land of New Zealand given to your forefathers and stolen by the Europeans. No need to fear or think much, He says; the miraculous power of the parentless _matua_ will guide you to victory. You just have to make sure the impurity is cleansed- kill every single inhabitant and animal in the cities you pass and do not take anything from the rubles you leave in their place. You find this a bit unnecessary, but ultimately agree, as Io would never command you to do something immoral. However, that's just the beginning: once about to attack Auckland, Io remarks you must spare the virgins for, _ahem_, later use. You also have some issues with killing surrendered enemies, or non combatants for that matter, and specially the children- but the High Priest assured you that killing the little ones is a mercy, lest they grow up to be wicked like their parents. You swallow your doubts and take the cities, aided by fiery stones falling from the skies to your enemies' heads. Not long after, you march to the only standing capital city of Wellington (the large following of pre-teen girls in chains close by) where you should build a temple to Io using only holy Kiwi feathers as furniture.

No one, in their right mind, would indulge the New Zealander's actions above as good or morally correct. However, this is the kind of thing (changed location or willingness, a bit) the purporters of argument from morality are used to rationalize once confronted with their religious texts. Yet, they insist in asking non-believers to account for moral, or demanding answers to silly questions like "what's the problem with killing babies if we are all just molecular machines?".

This argument is often presented, but, once scrutinized, the argumentators always fail to produce examples of absolute moral or where is such moral engraved. Is the Bible or any holy book the absolute moral standard? Then why it condones slavery, genocide and misogyny? Given how the notion of what's moral improves alongside social changes over time, God didn't put it in our "hearts" either. What the apologists fail to see is that if God picked the moral absolutes then they are just as "arbitrary": he could have chosen a different set of morals, and if he couldn't, what's the point? Society could find it as he did.

We, as humans beings, still have good reasons sans God to not go around pillaging cities or roasting babies from both logical and empathetic points of view: no society could ever exist if everyone thought killing was a-ok, and, of course, as I don't like to be hurt I can see how others might not enjoy it too- and societies had a _long_ time and _plenty_ of experiences to work out these concepts. The morals we have are not arbitrary in the sense they  are picked willy nilly, but rather that we think them through over the passing of time. As much as apologists act like these aren't good reasons and claim a "moral lawgiver" is necessary to morality be moral, in real life, as my caricature example, we see that such a thing only authorizes people to act heinous things in name of God's will and his "perfect" commandments.

* The presuppositional argument: God exists because God exists.

In comparison to the so called presuppositional apologetics, the arguments above look well reasoned and sophisticated. This line of religious defensors claims that logic, science or any kind of order in nature presupposes God. Without God, they affirm, no one can have any guarantees about reality or pretty much anything else- minds are reduced to absurdness; unable to evade metaphysical [solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism).

What these apologists never demonstrate is how _they_ are exempt of having to assume reality or logic; they literally just say that God does it, that is it, no further explanation needed. They believe the mere fact of sharing their faith to be sufficient evidence- that shows they want to preach rather than debate. This is what a presuppositionalist, and I kid you not, has to say about [whether is reasonable to believe in God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL8LREmbDi0):

* It is reasonable to believe what is true
* It is true that God exists
* Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that God exists

Evidence about God's existence? Forget about it- for a presuppositional you already know that God exists, and to try and convince someone of God's existence is sinful as it puts the person as judge of God. It does not matter if the argument makes sense or not (or if could be applied to any non-falsifiable idea whatsoever) the presuppositional apologetics always win by _definition_. Well, talk about circular.

**Conclusion**

As far as the classical arguments go, the affirmation of God's existence is a baseless claim: they fail for a generic God, let alone specific incarnations from x or y religion, and constitute no positive evidence for the theist view. If there are no reasons to believe something then it is obvious it shouldn't be accepted.
