The first time I watched the animation classic Hokuto no Ken, I realized something. No matter who the protagonist, Ken, fought the actual reason of the fight was _Love_. Let me explain.

Usually as the fight ends, the viewer learns the backstory of the antagonist: such stories invariantly featurs how the person had their loved one killed, was betrayed or how a sacrifice was made for them- i.e.: how Love underpinned their downfall to the evil side. Yuda loved Rei, the death of Souther's beloved master traumatized him, both Shin and Raoh idolatred Yuria. Even the good guy were tricked by love: Rei, Juuza would not pass half of their problems if not because of Love.
