title: Book catalog 1 - The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas
---

Published late 19th century, _The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas_ by Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis is the initial landmark of _Realism_ in Brazil. Realism, in contrast to its predecessor, Romanticism, employed a objective, cold view of reality, which is further advanced by Machado de Assis' playful prose, this time depicting a dead man, Bras Cubas, writing his autobiography. As he is already deceased, every embarrassment or public opinion amounts for nothing, liberating his pen to spew sarcastic deconstructions of many issues of the time such as slavery, or always current human affairs like friendship, treason and love.

>To the first worm that gnawed the cold flesh of my corpse I dedicate these posthumous memoirs as a nostalgic remembrance.

Bras Cubas opens up telling his death- caused by an untreated pneumonia as he was too far invested in an "grand and useful" idea to preoccupy himself with other things- and proceeds to recount his live from birth onwards.
