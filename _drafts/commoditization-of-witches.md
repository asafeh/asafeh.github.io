One thing that is often lacking in media featuring the "supernatural" is the material side. Allow me to explain.

As it goes, there is usually two worlds: the boring, regular one that doesn't differ much from ours and a sub, hidden another wherein magic happens. It could be that people are better off not knowing about it (e.g., the series _Supernatural_); it is taboo to talk about it (e.g., _The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina_); or only special people can wield it (the _Harry Potter_  books), perhaps using special tools (as in the manhwa _Red String_)
