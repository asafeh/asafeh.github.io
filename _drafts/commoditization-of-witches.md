title: The commoditization of witches Or: why hidden magic makes no sense

In media featuring the "supernatural", there is usually two worlds: the boring, plain one that doesn't differ much from ours and a sub, hidden another wherein magic happens. It could be that people are better off not knowing about it (e.g., the series _Supernatural_); it is taboo to talk about it (e.g., _The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina_); or only special people can wield it (the _Harry Potter_ books), perhaps using special tools (as in the manhwa _Red String_). Regardless, the clear divide must be kept -- regular folks cannot know about magic powers or any supernatural elements, and besides the odd characters they more often than not don't. On their side, magic people are to saveguard the secret, and then again, they usually manage it. This trope, however, should be abandoned.

[too hard to keep secret]
The very first reason why supernatural power or activies would never be a secret is that it is simply too much to be kept hidden. In the same way for all doctors to be in a "let's hide the cure for cancer" conspiracy, or all states band together to conceal that the Earth is flat, keeping all magical practioners shush is just not feasible. Someone will steal the cure. Someone will see demons showing up. 

[it would become a scientific matter]
The reason why we don't believe in mysticism is that there are always a better explanation, but if cases were to be documented every day, it is a safe be that exorcism and crystal energy channeling would be a scientific endeavor before long.

[capitalism rant]
Material conditions also play a huge role in any human activity. Again, in the same that rich people would buy off a cure for cancer (or a trip to the icy domes), witches would sell their potions and spells -- there is no way that a capitalist society would not drive magic forces for profit.
